If there's a read-only error, I’ll output diff instructions instead. But I want to finish this. Maybe I can use exec_command with heredoc to modify? Yet, that’s also writing. The tool mentions apply_patch along with others, so writing might be allowed despite the read-only message. I’ll check the project structure, likely Next.js 16, and see if `src/app` exists. Then I'll update scripts, dependencies, and add vitest config and tests, plus install Playwright."}}

The skill suggests running `npx playwright install chromium` once. I wonder if we can utilize `playwright-core` instead, but it ultimately relies on `playwright`, which also triggers browser downloads. Many CI setups run that installation step, but our goal is to pass the `npm run test:e2e`. I think we can add a `postinstall` script for Chromium. However, my main concern is ensuring efficiency while handling browser installations during `npm install`."}}

In this environment, `npm install` should download Chromium automatically unless dependencies are preinstalled and a new install isn't run. But I have to consider that network access is restricted, which means I can’t install new packages. I wonder if this restriction applies only to web tools and not npm.

However, it’s possible the necessary dependencies are already in the starter project. I should also look for vitest, playwright, dotenv, and TypeScript.
